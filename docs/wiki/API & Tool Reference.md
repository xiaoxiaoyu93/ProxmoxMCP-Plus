# API & Tool Reference

This page is the reference index for the ProxmoxMCP-Plus tool surface, the native MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint, and the OpenAPI wrapper that exposes tools as REST-style HTTP routes.

Use this page when you need exact tool names, input shapes, prerequisites, or common failure patterns. Use the [Operator Guide](Operator-Guide) for deployment and runtime setup, and the [Security Guide](Security-Guide) for policy and access controls.

## How To Read This Page

- `Read-only` tools inspect Proxmox state and should be your first call when validating reachability or inventory.
- `Mutating` tools create, start, stop, change, restore, or delete infrastructure.
- Tool availability depends on runtime configuration. In particular, some command-execution tools are only registered when `ssh` config is present.
- MCP Streamable HTTP mode exposes the native MCP endpoint at `/mcp`.
- OpenAPI mode is a bridge over the same MCP tool surface. The generated schema at `/openapi.json` is the source of truth for the exact request and response shape exposed by the running server.

## Native MCP Streamable HTTP Endpoint

When `mcp.transport` is `STREAMABLE_HTTP` or `STREAMABLE`, the server exposes the MCP endpoint at:

| Path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/mcp` | MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint | use this for remote MCP clients that support Streamable HTTP |

The Docker Compose `mcp-http` profile exposes this endpoint on port `8000`.

## OpenAPI Service Endpoints

When the OpenAPI wrapper is enabled, the primary endpoints are:

| Path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | service metadata | basic wrapper metadata |
| `/docs` | Swagger UI | interactive API docs for the currently running tool set |
| `/openapi.json` | generated OpenAPI schema | reflects conditional tool registration such as SSH-backed tools |
| `/livez` | liveness check | unauthenticated, minimal process liveness |
| `/readyz` | readiness check | requires OpenAPI auth and reports MCP backend connectivity |
| `/health` | readiness alias | requires OpenAPI auth and matches `/readyz` |
| `/metrics` | Prometheus metrics | includes per-route labels for `route`, `method`, and `status` |
| `/jobs` | persistent job list | requires a local `JobStore` in the OpenAPI process |

## Global Behavior And Constraints

### Authentication and Authorization

- Proxmox API access requires a valid `proxmox` and `auth` configuration.
- OpenAPI access requires `Authorization: Bearer <PROXMOX_API_KEY>` by default. Startup without an API key requires the explicit local-development override `PROXMOX_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true`.
- SSH-backed container command workflows require a valid `ssh` configuration.
- Command-execution tools are subject to command-policy checks. Depending on policy, a request can be allowed, denied, or require an `approval_token`.
- Detailed policy behavior lives in the [Security Guide](Security-Guide).

### Output Conventions

- Some tools return human-readable text by default.
- Several container tools support `format_style` with `pretty` or `json`.
- In HTTP mode, exact request and response payloads should be verified against `/openapi.json` for the running server version.
- Long-running mutating tools can return both a raw Proxmox `task_id` and a stable `job_id`.

### Job Tracking Conventions

- `job_id` is the MCP and OpenAPI stable identifier for a long-running operation.
- `task_id` remains the raw Proxmox `UPID` and can change when a job is retried.
- Job records persist in the configured SQLite database and survive process restart.
- `retry_job` only works when the job was created with a stored retry recipe.
- `cancel_job` is best-effort and follows Proxmox task cancellation semantics.

### OpenAPI Job Status Codes

- `200`: list, fetch, or poll succeeded
- `202`: cancel or retry request accepted
- `404`: unknown `job_id`
- `409`: the job exists but cannot perform that action now
- `503`: the OpenAPI wrapper has no local `JobStore`

### Common Prerequisites

- Mutating tools assume the target node, VM, container, storage pool, or archive already exists unless the tool itself creates it.
- VM command execution requires a running VM with QEMU Guest Agent available.
- Container command execution requires SSH to the Proxmox host and a running target container.
- Backup restore uses a new target `vmid`; it is not an in-place overwrite workflow.

### Container Selector Grammar

Several container tools accept a `selector` parameter. Supported forms:

- `123`
- `pve1:123`
- `pve1/name`
- `name`
- comma-separated lists for bulk operations

Selector-based tools fail when no container matches the selector or when a bulk selector includes invalid targets.

## Node Tools

| Tool | Mode | Required Inputs | Optional Inputs | Prerequisites | Common Failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `get_nodes` | Read-only | none | none | Proxmox API reachable | auth failure, API unavailable |
| `get_node_status` | Read-only | `node` | none | target node exists | unknown node, auth failure |

## VM Tools

| Tool | Mode | Required Inputs | Optional Inputs | Prerequisites | Common Failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `get_vms` | Read-only | none | none | Proxmox API reachable | partial node-query failures may reduce returned coverage |
| `get_vm_interfaces` | Read-only | `node`, `vmid` | none | VM exists and QEMU Guest Agent is running | guest agent unavailable, VM not found, VM not running |
| `create_vm` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid`, `name`, `cpus`, `memory`, `disk_size` | `storage`, `ostype`, `network_bridge`, `pool` | target node exists and selected storage is valid | duplicate `vmid`, invalid storage or resource pool, insufficient permissions or resources |
| `clone_vm` | Mutating | `node`, `source_vmid`, `target_vmid` | `name`, `target_node`, `full=true`, `storage`, `pool`, `snapname` | source VM exists and target VM ID is free | duplicate target VM ID, clone permission failure, invalid storage or snapshot |
| `start_vm` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid` | none | VM exists | VM not found, node mismatch |
| `stop_vm` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid` | none | VM exists | VM not found, stop failure from Proxmox |
| `shutdown_vm` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid` | none | VM exists | guest shutdown unavailable or timeout on guest side |
| `reset_vm` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid` | none | VM exists | VM not found, reset rejected by Proxmox |
| `delete_vm` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid` | `force=false` | VM exists | running VM without `force`, VM not found |
| `execute_vm_command` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid`, `command` | `approval_token` | VM running, QEMU Guest Agent installed, policy allows command | guest agent unavailable, VM not running, policy denial |
| `get_vm_config` | Read-only | `node`, `vmid` | none | VM exists | VM not found, node mismatch |
| `set_vm_description` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid`, `description` | none | VM exists and API token can update its config | VM not found, node mismatch, insufficient permissions |

### VM Notes

- `stop_vm` is the force-stop path. Use `shutdown_vm` for graceful guest shutdown when supported.
- `get_vm_interfaces` reads guest NIC and IP data from QEMU Guest Agent (`network-get-interfaces`).
- `execute_vm_command` is not a generic SSH shell. It is mediated through QEMU Guest Agent and command-policy checks.
- `create_vm.pool` is an optional Proxmox resource pool, not a storage pool. Pool-scoped API tokens also need `Pool.Allocate` on the target pool.
- `create_vm`, `clone_vm`, `start_vm`, `stop_vm`, `shutdown_vm`, `reset_vm`, and `delete_vm` register persistent jobs when they return asynchronous Proxmox tasks.

## Container Tools

| Tool | Mode | Required Inputs | Optional Inputs | Prerequisites | Common Failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `get_containers` | Read-only | none | `node`, `include_stats=false`, `include_raw=false`, `format_style=pretty\|json`, legacy `payload` object | Proxmox API reachable | invalid payload shape, auth failure |
| `start_container` | Mutating | `selector` | `format_style=pretty\|json` | selector resolves to one or more containers | no selector match, start failure from Proxmox |
| `stop_container` | Mutating | `selector` | `graceful=true`, `timeout_seconds=10`, `format_style=pretty\|json` | selector resolves to one or more containers | no selector match, timeout on graceful shutdown, container already stopped |
| `restart_container` | Mutating | `selector` | `timeout_seconds=10`, `format_style=pretty\|json` | selector resolves to one or more containers | no selector match, reboot failure |
| `update_container_resources` | Mutating | `selector` | `cores`, `memory`, `swap`, `disk_gb`, `disk=rootfs`, `format_style=pretty\|json` | selector resolves to one or more containers | no selector match, invalid resize target, resource update rejected |
| `create_container` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid`, `ostemplate` | `hostname`, `cores=1`, `memory=512`, `swap=512`, `disk_size=8`, `storage`, `password`, `ssh_public_keys`, `network_bridge=vmbr0`, `start_after_create=false`, `onboot=false`, `nesting=false`, `unprivileged=true`, `pool` | target node exists, template path valid, target storage valid | duplicate `vmid`, missing template, invalid storage, resource pool, or bridge |
| `delete_container` | Mutating | `selector` | `force=false`, `format_style=pretty\|json` | selector resolves to one or more containers | no selector match, running container without `force`, delete failure |
| `execute_container_command` | Mutating | `selector`, `command` | `approval_token` | only registered when `ssh` config exists; container must be running; policy must allow command | tool unavailable without SSH config, no selector match, SSH failure, policy denial |
| `update_container_ssh_keys` | Mutating/high-risk | `node`, `vmid`, `public_keys` | `mode=append\|replace`, `approval_token` | only registered when `ssh` config exists; target container reachable through configured execution path; high-risk policy must allow the operation | tool unavailable without SSH config, invalid container target, SSH failure, approval required |
| `get_container_config` | Read-only | `node`, `vmid` | none | target container exists | container not found, node mismatch |
| `set_container_description` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid`, `description` | none | target container exists and API token can update its config | container not found, node mismatch, insufficient permissions |
| `get_container_ip` | Read-only | `node`, `vmid` | none | target container exists | container not found, IP information unavailable |

### Container Notes

- `get_containers` exposes flat top-level parameters for stricter MCP clients. The legacy `payload` object is still accepted for existing callers.
- `update_container_resources.disk_gb` is an additional resize amount for the selected disk, not a full replacement size target.
- `create_container.start_after_create` controls immediate startup after provisioning.
- `create_container.nesting` and `create_container.unprivileged` change container execution characteristics and should match your Proxmox policy.
- `create_container.pool` is an optional Proxmox resource pool, not the `storage` used for `rootfs`. Pool-scoped API tokens also need `Pool.Allocate` on the target pool.
- `create_container`, `start_container`, `stop_container`, `restart_container`, and `delete_container` create persistent job records for asynchronous task tracking.

## Snapshot Tools

| Tool | Mode | Required Inputs | Optional Inputs | Prerequisites | Common Failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `list_snapshots` | Read-only | `node`, `vmid` | `vm_type=qemu\|lxc` | target VM or container exists | wrong `vm_type`, missing target |
| `create_snapshot` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid`, `snapname` | `description`, `vmstate=false`, `vm_type=qemu\|lxc` | target exists | duplicate snapshot name, unsupported `vmstate` use, wrong target type |
| `delete_snapshot` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid`, `snapname` | `vm_type=qemu\|lxc` | snapshot exists | snapshot not found, wrong target type |
| `rollback_snapshot` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid`, `snapname` | `vm_type=qemu\|lxc` | snapshot exists | snapshot not found, rollback rejected by Proxmox |

### Snapshot Notes

- `rollback_snapshot` is a disruptive restore action and should be treated as an operationally sensitive step.
- `vmstate` applies to VM snapshots and is not a general LXC memory-capture option.
- `create_snapshot`, `delete_snapshot`, and `rollback_snapshot` all register persistent jobs when Proxmox returns a task `UPID`.

## ISO and Template Tools

| Tool | Mode | Required Inputs | Optional Inputs | Prerequisites | Common Failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `list_isos` | Read-only | none | `node`, `storage` | Proxmox API reachable | invalid node or storage filter |
| `list_templates` | Read-only | none | `node`, `storage` | Proxmox API reachable | invalid node or storage filter |
| `download_iso` | Mutating | `node`, `storage`, `url`, `filename` | `checksum`, `checksum_algorithm=sha256` | target storage writable and reachable by Proxmox | invalid URL, checksum mismatch, unsupported storage target |
| `delete_iso` | Mutating | `node`, `storage`, `filename` | none | file exists in target storage | file not found, storage mismatch |

### ISO and Template Notes

- `list_templates` is commonly used to discover a valid `ostemplate` value for `create_container`.
- When `checksum` is supplied, `checksum_algorithm` must match the provided digest.
- `download_iso` and `delete_iso` register jobs so callers can poll progress from the same `job_id`.

## Backup Tools

| Tool | Mode | Required Inputs | Optional Inputs | Prerequisites | Common Failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `list_backups` | Read-only | none | `node`, `storage`, `vmid` | backup-capable storage reachable | invalid filter or storage mismatch |
| `create_backup` | Mutating | `node`, `vmid`, `storage` | `compress=0\|gzip\|lz4\|zstd`, `mode=snapshot\|suspend\|stop`, `notes` | target workload exists and storage accepts backups | invalid mode, storage unavailable, backup job rejected |
| `restore_backup` | Mutating | `node`, `archive`, `vmid` | `storage`, `unique=true` | archive exists and target `vmid` is free | missing archive, duplicate target `vmid`, invalid target storage |
| `delete_backup` | Mutating | `node`, `storage`, `volid` | none | backup volume exists | volume not found, storage mismatch |

### Backup Notes

- `restore_backup` restores into a new `vmid`.
- `create_backup.mode` changes how Proxmox coordinates workload state during backup and may affect runtime interruption characteristics.
- `create_backup`, `restore_backup`, and `delete_backup` register persistent jobs and support later `poll`, `cancel`, and `retry` through the job surface.

## Job Tools

| Tool | Mode | Required Inputs | Optional Inputs | Prerequisites | Common Failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `list_jobs` | Read-only | none | `status`, `tool_name`, `limit=100` | in-process `JobStore` enabled | job store unavailable |
| `get_job` | Read-only | `job_id` | `refresh=false` | job exists | unknown `job_id` |
| `poll_job` | Mutating | `job_id` | none | job exists and has a Proxmox `UPID` | unknown `job_id`, backend poll failure |
| `cancel_job` | Mutating | `job_id` | none | job exists and supports cancellation | unknown `job_id`, no `UPID`, cancel conflict |
| `retry_job` | Mutating | `job_id` | none | job exists and has a retry recipe | unknown `job_id`, no retry recipe, handler unavailable |

### Job Notes

- `get_job(refresh=true)` is the HTTP equivalent of calling `poll_job`.
- Completed jobs stay queryable until you remove the SQLite file or add retention logic.
- `previous_upids` records earlier Proxmox task IDs after retries.
- `audit_log` stores creation, polling, retry, and cancellation events for operator review.

## Storage and Cluster Tools

| Tool | Mode | Required Inputs | Optional Inputs | Prerequisites | Common Failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `get_storage` | Read-only | none | none | Proxmox API reachable | auth failure, cluster query failure |
| `get_cluster_status` | Read-only | none | none | Proxmox API reachable | auth failure, cluster query failure |
