  - no new runtime tools or endpoints
- Changed behavior:
  - `docker/login-action` is pinned to the signed v4.6.0 commit
  - `docker/metadata-action` is pinned to the signed v6.2.0 commit
  - `docker/build-push-action` is pinned to the signed v7.3.0 commit
  - a regression test rejects mutable refs for every `docker/*` Action in the container release workflow
  - the v0.5.11 native AMD64/ARM64 build and post-publication ARM64 health gate remain unchanged
- Removed or deprecated behavior:
  - no removals or deprecations
- Config changes:
  - no runtime configuration migration
- Docs updated:

  - downgrade to `v0.5.11` only if the pinned release workflow is incompatible with a repository-specific Actions policy

### Version `0.5.11`

- Release date: 2026-07-29
- Summary: publishes the GHCR container as a native multi-architecture image for AMD64 and ARM64 hosts (closes issue #109).
- New tools or endpoints:
  - no new runtime tools or endpoints
- Changed behavior:
  - GHCR release tags now contain native `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` images under one multi-architecture manifest
  - Docker automatically selects the matching image on Apple Silicon and other ARM64 hosts instead of falling back to AMD64 emulation
  - the release workflow limits QEMU registration to ARM64, pins the new QEMU and Buildx actions to reviewed commit SHAs, and pins the QEMU helper image by OCI digest
  - Docker build contexts exclude local tool state, environment files, private-key patterns, and non-example Proxmox JSON configuration files
  - the final runtime image removes `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` after installation to reduce dormant build-tool attack surface
  - the multi-architecture Python base image is pinned by OCI digest
  - a native ARM64 release job pulls the published image and verifies its manifest, architecture, non-root runtime, and `/livez` endpoint
- Removed or deprecated behavior:
  - no removals or deprecations
- Config changes:
  - no runtime configuration migration
- Docs updated:
  - `docs/releases/v0.5.11.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Release & Upgrade Notes.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - pull `ghcr.io/rekklesna/proxmoxmcp-plus:0.5.11` or `latest` normally; Docker selects the host architecture automatically
  - no Compose or MCP client configuration change is required
- Rollback notes:
  - use `v0.5.10` if a registry or Docker installation cannot consume a multi-architecture manifest

### Version `0.5.10`

- Release date: 2026-07-23
- Summary: adds first-class MCP tools for setting or clearing the Proxmox Notes field on individual QEMU VMs and LXC containers.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - `set_vm_description`
  - `set_container_description`
- Changed behavior:
  - callers can replace a VM or container description through the native Proxmox config endpoint
  - passing an empty description clears the existing Notes field
  - each call targets exactly one `node` and `vmid`; no selector or multi-target behavior is introduced
- Removed or deprecated behavior:
  - no removals or deprecations
- Config changes:
  - no runtime configuration migration
- Docs updated:
  - `docs/releases/v0.5.10.md`
  - `docs/wiki/API & Tool Reference.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Release & Upgrade Notes.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - no migration is required
  - ensure the configured Proxmox API token can update the target VM or container configuration before using the new tools
- Rollback notes:
  - downgrade to `v0.5.9` only if a client cannot accept the two additional MCP tool definitions

### Version `0.5.9`

- Release date: 2026-07-16
- Summary: adds optional Proxmox resource-pool targeting to VM and LXC creation, enabling pool-scoped API-token security boundaries (closes issue #104).
- New tools or endpoints:
  - no new runtime tools or endpoints
- Changed behavior:
  - `create_vm` accepts an optional `pool` argument and forwards it to `POST /nodes/{node}/qemu`
  - `create_container` accepts an optional `pool` argument and forwards it to `POST /nodes/{node}/lxc`
  - omitting `pool` preserves the previous request payload and behavior
  - tests use Starlette's supported `httpx2` client path, eliminating the deprecated `httpx` fallback warning
  - the development test stack now requires `pytest>=9.0.3` and `pytest-asyncio>=1.4.0`, removing the vulnerable pytest versions reported as `PYSEC-2026-1845`
- Removed or deprecated behavior:
  - no removals or deprecations
- Config changes:
  - no required runtime config migration
  - development/test installs now include `httpx2>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`, `pytest>=9.0.3,<10.0.0`, and `pytest-asyncio>=1.4.0,<2.0.0`
- Docs updated:
  - `docs/releases/v0.5.9.md`
  - `docs/wiki/API & Tool Reference.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Release & Upgrade Notes.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - no required migration
  - pass `pool=<resource-pool-name>` only when VM/LXC creation should be scoped to a Proxmox resource pool
  - grant `Pool.Allocate` on the target pool in addition to the required VM permissions
- Rollback notes:
  - downgrade to `v0.5.8` only if a client cannot accept the two new optional schema fields; omitting them is already backward compatible

### Version `0.5.8`

- Release date: 2026-06-07
- Summary: Windows / headless SSH compatibility fixes for `execute_container_command` and `get_node_status` (closes issue #100).
- New tools or endpoints:
  - no new runtime tools or endpoints
- Changed behavior:
  - `_execute_via_system_ssh()` now passes `-l <user>`, `stdin=DEVNULL`, `-o BatchMode=yes`, and `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` so OpenSSH works on Windows and in headless / TTY-less environments
  - `get_node_status()` now injects `status: "online"` when the API response omits the field, fixing the always-UNKNOWN display
  - `node_status()` template now reads CPU core count from `cpuinfo.cpus` (with a `maxcpu` fallback), fixing the always-N/A display
- Removed or deprecated behavior:
  - no removals or deprecations
- Config changes:
  - no required config migration
- Docs updated:
  - `docs/releases/v0.5.8.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Release & Upgrade Notes.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - no required migration
- Rollback notes:
  - downgrade to `v0.5.7` only if a Windows deployment needs to keep the previous SSH command shape; doing so restores the broken behaviour fixed in this release

- Upgrade steps:
  - no required migration
  - review the new Client Setup and Tool Selection Guide pages when onboarding new MCP clients
- Rollback notes:
  - downgrade to `v0.5.5` only if a deployment needs to stay on the previous package metadata; doing so removes the improved README, wiki routing, and LLM documentation index

### Version `0.5.5`

- Release date: 2026-05-29
- Summary: quality-gate release that closes API SSH tunnels during server shutdown, validates CI on Python 3.11 and 3.12, and raises the enforced coverage gate to 75%.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - no new runtime tools or endpoints
- Changed behavior:
  - server shutdown now explicitly releases the Proxmox API SSH tunnel manager instead of relying only on process exit cleanup
  - CI runs the validation stack against Python 3.11 and 3.12
  - coverage enforcement increased from 70% to 75%
- Config changes:
  - no required config migration
- Docs updated:

### Version `0.5.4`

- Release date: 2026-05-29
- Summary: quality and release-safety update that raises the coverage gate, adds user-path tests for high-traffic tools, enforces release metadata parity, removes unused utility code, improves Docker build caching, and makes boolean environment parsing consistent.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - no new runtime tools or endpoints
- Changed behavior:
  - invalid boolean environment values now fail startup validation instead of being interpreted as false
  - manifest parity tests now exercise the runtime plugin registration path rather than parsing source text
  - Docker builds can reuse the package-install layer when only repository files outside package metadata/source change
- Removed or deprecated behavior:
  - removed the unused `proxmox_mcp.utils` package
- Config changes:
  - `PROXMOX_VERIFY_SSL`, `PROXMOX_API_TUNNEL_ENABLED`, `PROXMOX_DEV_MODE`, `COMMAND_POLICY_REQUIRE_APPROVAL_TOKEN`, and `COMMAND_POLICY_HIGH_RISK_REQUIRE_APPROVAL_TOKEN` now share strict boolean parsing
- Docs updated:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/releases/v0.5.4.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Developer Guide.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Home.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Release & Upgrade Notes.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - no required migration
  - check deployment environment files for invalid boolean strings before upgrading
- Rollback notes:
  - downgrade to `v0.5.3` only if a deployment depends on previously invalid boolean values being treated as false; doing so removes the stronger metadata and coverage guardrails

### Version `0.5.3`

- Release date: 2026-05-27
- Summary: security-hardening release that aligns the published manifest with all runtime tools, redacts command and error logs, bounds OpenAPI rate-limiter bucket growth, adds configurable MCP DNS rebinding protection, and expands regression coverage for high-risk operations.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - no new runtime tools or endpoints; `manifest.json` now declares all 42 registered tools
- Changed behavior:
  - VM and LXC command execution logs no longer include command text, command output, or command error content
  - OpenSSH LXC execution and API SSH tunnel debug logs no longer expose full command lines or local SSH key paths
  - OpenAPI job route errors log sanitized summaries instead of raw traceback text
  - the OpenAPI rate limiter periodically removes expired empty client buckets
  - MCP HTTP transports can opt into explicit DNS rebinding protection, Host allowlists, and Origin allowlists
- Config changes:
  - added `mcp.dns_rebinding_protection`, `mcp.allowed_hosts`, and `mcp.allowed_origins`
  - added `MCP_DNS_REBINDING_PROTECTION`, `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`

  - `docs/wiki/Release & Upgrade Notes.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Security Guide.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Operator Guide.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Integrations Guide.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - no required migration for stdio deployments
  - configure allowed hosts and origins before exposing HTTP transports behind a reverse proxy
- Rollback notes:
  - downgrade to `v0.5.2` only if the deployment cannot run the MCP SDK version needed for configured transport security; doing so reopens manifest drift and log-redaction gaps

### Version `0.5.2`

- Release date: 2026-05-12
- Summary: job concurrency and operator-safety patch that atomically claims retries, protects cancel writes from stale UPIDs, aligns legacy packaging constraints, and extends high-risk approval policy to SSH key injection.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - no new tools or endpoints
- Changed behavior:
  - `retry_job` moves eligible jobs to `retrying` before replaying an operation, so concurrent retries conflict instead of running twice
  - `cancel_job` records `cancel_discarded` instead of overwriting a newer UPID or terminal/retrying state
  - `update_container_ssh_keys` is now treated as a high-risk operation
  - `get_containers(include_raw=true, format_style="json")` includes `raw_status` and `raw_config` when stats are fetched
  - API SSH tunnels honor configured SSH user, port, key file, known hosts file, and strict host-key checking
  - logging setup replaces project-managed handlers instead of accumulating duplicates
- Config changes:
  - `COMMAND_POLICY_HIGH_RISK_OPERATIONS` defaults now include `update_container_ssh_keys`
  - legacy `setup.py` installs now require `paramiko>=5.0.0,<6.0.0`
- Docs updated:
  - `docs/releases/v0.5.2.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Release & Upgrade Notes.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - pass `approval_token` to `update_container_ssh_keys` when high-risk approval enforcement is enabled
  - retry clients should treat `retrying` as an in-progress state and poll the job before another retry
- Rollback notes:
  - downgrade to `v0.5.1` only if callers cannot yet pass approval tokens for SSH key updates; doing so reopens duplicate retry and stale cancel risks

### Version `0.5.1`

- Release date: 2026-05-12
- Summary: persistent job safety patch that blocks duplicate retries for running or completed jobs, discards stale poll results after a retry swaps UPIDs, and protects direct OpenAPI `/jobs` routes when an app is created with an API key but without strict middleware.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - no new tools or endpoints
- Changed behavior:
  - `retry_job` only replays jobs in `failed`, `cancelled`, or `cancel_requested` states
  - `poll_job` records `poll_discarded` instead of overwriting a job when the polled UPID is stale
  - direct OpenAPI `/jobs` routes reuse API-key verification in non-strict `create_app` usage
- Config changes:
  - no required config migration
- Docs updated:
  - `docs/releases/v0.5.1.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Release & Upgrade Notes.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - poll jobs before retrying and retry only failed or cancelled jobs
  - keep sending `Authorization: Bearer <PROXMOX_API_KEY>` for OpenAPI job routes
- Rollback notes:
  - downgrade to `v0.5.0` only if callers depend on retrying completed jobs; doing so reopens the duplicate-operation risk

### Version `0.5.0`

- Release date: 2026-05-11
- Summary: OpenAPI security baseline release with required API-key startup, project-owned constant-time auth middleware, auth-failure rate limiting, split liveness/readiness probes, live E2E auth updates, and Paramiko 5.0.0.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - `/livez` for unauthenticated process liveness
  - `/readyz` for authenticated backend readiness
- Changed behavior:
  - OpenAPI mode refuses to start without `PROXMOX_API_KEY` unless `PROXMOX_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true` is set
  - OpenAPI requests require `Authorization: Bearer <PROXMOX_API_KEY>` by default
  - OpenAPI API key verification uses project-owned constant-time comparison
  - auth failures pass through rate limiting before the auth decision
  - `/health` remains available as an authenticated readiness alias
  - live E2E and Docker OpenAPI checks send Bearer auth
  - `scripts/start_openapi.sh` uses `.venv/bin/python` for proxy startup and dependency checks
- Removed or deprecated behavior:
  - unauthenticated OpenAPI startup is no longer the default
  - the temporary `CVE-2026-44405` `pip-audit` exception is removed
- Config changes:
  - `PROXMOX_API_KEY` is required for OpenAPI mode unless `PROXMOX_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true`

  - `docs/wiki/Integrations Guide.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Operator Guide.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Release & Upgrade Notes.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Security Guide.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - set `PROXMOX_API_KEY` before starting OpenAPI mode
  - update HTTP clients to send `Authorization: Bearer <PROXMOX_API_KEY>`
  - use `/livez` for unauthenticated process liveness
  - use authenticated `/readyz` or `/health` for backend readiness
  - verify SSH endpoints do not depend on legacy RSA/SHA-1, SHA-1 KEX, or GSSAPI before adopting Paramiko 5
- Rollback notes:
  - downgrade to `v0.4.9` if clients cannot yet send OpenAPI auth headers, but keep the Paramiko CVE tracking and OpenAPI no-auth exposure in mind

### Version `0.4.9`

- Release date: 2026-05-09
- Summary: supersedes `v0.4.8` with the same reliability hardening plus a CodeQL-blocking log-injection fix for high-risk retry audit logs.

### Version `0.4.8`

- Release date: 2026-05-09
- Summary: production reliability and release-quality hardening for persistent jobs, inventory reads, OpenAPI job controls, metrics, Paramiko tracking, and `clone_vm`.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - no new tools
- Changed behavior:
  - `clone_vm` now registers persistent jobs and returns a stable Job ID
  - high-risk job retries now pass through the same approval-token policy checks as direct tool execution
  - VM guest-agent commands poll until exit and report non-zero exit codes as failures
  - `get_vms` and default `get_containers` use cluster resource inventory to avoid large N+1 scans
  - `get_containers` defaults `include_stats=false`; detailed per-container status/config/RRD remains opt-in
  - OpenAPI metrics use route templates instead of raw paths for request labels
  - `JobStore` SQLite uses WAL, busy timeout, migration tracking, indexes, SQL filtering/limits, and explicit close lifecycle
- Config changes:
  - no required config migration

  - monitor Paramiko releases and remove the temporary `CVE-2026-44405` audit exception once a fixed PyPI release exists
- Rollback notes:
  - downgrade to `v0.4.7` if clients depend on default container stats, but keep the Paramiko CVE tracking in mind

### Version `0.4.7`

- Upgrade steps:
  - add a persistent path for `jobs.sqlite_path` in long-lived deployments
  - update config from `proxmox-config/config.example.json`
  - if you depend on async tooling, switch client logic to keep `job_id` and not just `task_id`
  - if you use OpenAPI, update monitors and clients to account for `/metrics` and `/jobs`
- Rollback notes:
  - older versions cannot read back persisted jobs through `/jobs`
  - clients written against `job_id` should be reverted together with the server downgrade

## Suggested Upgrade Checklist

Before upgrading:

- review changes to config examples
- review command policy defaults
- review OpenAPI wrapper behavior if your deployment depends on `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/health`, or auth
- check whether any new tool requires extra credentials or runtime dependencies

After upgrading:

- start the service and confirm config validation still passes
- call `get_nodes` and `get_cluster_status`
- verify expected tools are still registered
- verify unauthenticated `/livez` plus authenticated `/readyz`, `/health`, and `/docs` if you run the OpenAPI proxy
- test at least one mutating workflow in a safe environment

## Suggested Release Checklist

- run `pytest -q --cov=proxmox_mcp --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=75`
- run `ruff check .`
- run `mypy src --ignore-missing-imports`
- run `pip-audit -r requirements.txt`
- build the package
- confirm `README.md` and `docs/wiki/` reflect the released behavior
- note any user-visible changes here
